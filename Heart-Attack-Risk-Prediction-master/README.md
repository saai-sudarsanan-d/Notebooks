# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
# A Model that predicts if a person faces a risk of  a Cardiovascular Heart Disease by taking certain inputs.

age - age(age in years)

sex - sex(1 = male; 0 = female)

cp - chest pain type (4 values)(1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)

trestbp - resting blood pressure(in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl ( 0 or 1 )

restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)(0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy)

thalach - maximum heart rate achieved

exang - exercise induced angina

oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment(1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)

ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
