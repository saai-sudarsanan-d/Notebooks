# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
A Model that predicts if a person faces a risk of  a Cardiovascular Heart Disease by taking certain inputs.

age - age(age in years)
sex - sex(1 = male; 0 = female)
cp - chest pain type (4 values)(1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
trestbp - resting blood pressure(in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl ( 0 or 1 )
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)(0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy)
thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
exang - exercise induced angina
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment(1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)
ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
